intro = """This web app is designed to show how one can simply deploy a machine learning model. 
A web app like this could enable non-technical employees to easily leverage the model's predictions in their work, 
or explain the logic behind the model's predictions. For this example, we'll be using the famous [Boston housing dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html),
 as provided by `scikit-learn`."""

model_explanation = """Let's assume that we are using a simple decision tree to estimate how we should value a new house that hits the market.
We'll restrain our tree to have a `max_depth` of 2. After fitting the tree, it is relatively easy to make predictions about new houses, but what is often more
important to stakeholders is *why* the model makes its predictions. The good news for us is that decision trees lend themselves particularly well to visual interpretation.
In fact, using the [`dtreeviz`](https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz) package, we can generate a nice svg that even highlights the path that a particular observation takes down
the tree."""

slider_explanation = """Since we know that our decision tree identified the `RM` and `LSTAT` features as most important to predicting the house price,
we can allow the user to input their own values for these two features and observe how the model's predictions change."""

postgres_explanation = """The user may also be interested in seeing the specific datapoints that fall into each leaf of the tree. Since we've 
connected our postgres database containing the `boston` table to this web app, we can generate the query needed to retrieve those datapoints,
and even display this data directly from the database.

##### *Note: this query and table will change as the input from the sliders above changes.*"""
